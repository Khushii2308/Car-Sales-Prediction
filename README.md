# Car-Sales-Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast product sales using historical sales data. By analyzing various factors like advertising spend, promotions, customer segmentation, and other variables, the model predicts future sales and helps businesses optimize marketing strategies for growth. The objective is to develop an accurate predictive model that can be used for strategic decision-making to improve sales performance.

## Key Features:
*Sales: Historical sales data that represents the number of units sold over time.

*Advertising Spend: The amount spent on advertising.

*Promotions: The presence or absence of promotional offers.

*Customer Segmentation: Information about customer groups (e.g., demographics, location, etc.).

*Date/Time: Temporal features that can capture seasonal trends and patterns.

*Other variables: Any additional features like product categories, store location, and weather.

## Expected Outcome:
A machine learning model capable of accurately predicting future sales, providing businesses with insights into the impact of various factors on sales performance.

## Installation
To start using the Sales Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sales-Prediction.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

cd Sales-Prediction

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in building a successful predictive model. The following preprocessing steps are performed:

*Handling Missing Values: Missing values are imputed or dropped based on their impact on the data and the model.

*Outlier Detection: We detect and handle outliers using statistical techniques such as the Z-score or IQR to ensure that extreme values do not negatively affect model performance.

*Feature Scaling: Continuous features (e.g., advertising spend, sales, etc.) are scaled using normalization or standardization techniques to ensure that they contribute equally to the model’s performance.

*Feature Engineering: We create new features that could be important for sales prediction, such as:

*Time-based features (e.g., day of the week, month, seasonality).

*Interaction features (e.g., interaction between advertising spend and promotions).

*Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables like customer segmentation are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Model Building
This project explores several machine learning models to predict sales:

1. Linear Regression: A simple, interpretable model for understanding the relationship between features and sales.

2. Random Forest: A powerful ensemble model that can handle complex non-linear relationships.

3. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): A model that builds strong predictions through boosting weak learners.

4. Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that performs well on both linear and non-linear problems.

Each model is trained and tuned using the processed dataset to select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Model Evaluation
To assess the performance of the models, the following evaluation metrics are used:

*Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual sales values.

*Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between the predicted and actual sales.

*Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing a clearer measure of the magnitude of errors.

*R-Squared (R²): The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (sales) that is predictable from the independent variables (features).

The model that provides the best balance of low error and high predictive power is selected for final deployment.

## Results
The model's performance is tested on a separate test dataset (sales_test.csv). The predictions are saved in sales_predictions.csv for further analysis or submission.

### Example usage of the prediction results:

#### Load the predictions
predictions = pd.read_csv('outputs/sales_predictions.csv')

#### Display the predictions
print(predictions.head())

## Usage

### Example input data

sample_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'customer name':['Quin Smith'],
    'country': ['Nicaragua'], 
    'gender': [0], 
    'age': [44], 
    'annual Salary': [37336], 
    'credit card debt': [10218], 
    'net worth': [430907],
    'customer e-mail': ['nulla@ipsum.edu']
})

### Make prediction
predicted_value = model.predict(sample_data)
print(f"Predicted Car Purchase Amount: ${predicted_value[0]:,.2f}")
